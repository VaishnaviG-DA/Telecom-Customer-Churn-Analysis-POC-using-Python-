# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (POC)

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Proof of Concept (POC)** analyzes customer churn patterns in the telecom sector using a **Kaggle dataset** of 7,043 records and 21 attributes. The project leverages **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** in **Google Colab** to identify high-risk customer segments, visualize trends, and suggest data-driven retention strategies.

## 🗂 Dataset Details
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Rows:** 7,043
- **Columns:** 21
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🎯 KPIs & Analysis Dimensions
- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.5%
- **Churn by Gender:** 27% (Male), 26% (Female)
- **Churn by Tenure:** >50% churn within first 12 months
- **Churn by Contract Type:** 42% churn in month-to-month contracts vs. 11% in long-term contracts
- **Churn by Phone Services:** Slightly higher churn among customers with multiple lines
- **Churn by Payment Mode:** 45% churn among electronic check users

## 🔍 Key Insights (Business Perspective)
- **Short-tenure customers** and **month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn risk → potential for **early retention campaigns** and **long-term contract incentives**.
- **Electronic check users** churn at a significantly higher rate → opportunity to encourage **more secure/automated payment methods**.
- Service bundling (phone + internet + streaming) showed mixed impact, indicating need for **targeted bundle offerings**.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & transformation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Kaggle Dataset** – Open-source telecom churn data

## 📈 Business Impact (Simulated for POC)
If applied in a real-world scenario, these insights could:
- Reduce churn by **10–15%** via targeted loyalty programs.
- Increase long-term contract adoption by **20%**.
- Lower revenue loss from high-risk groups by **optimizing payment mode incentives**.
